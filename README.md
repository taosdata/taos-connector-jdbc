## 1. Introduction
`taos-jdbcdriver` is the official Java connector for TDengine, allowing Java developers to develop applications that access the TDengine database. `taos-jdbcdriver` implements the standard interfaces of the JDBC driver and supports functions such as data writing, querying, subscription, schemaless writing, and parameter binding.

## 2. Documentation  
- For development examples, see [Developer Guide](https://docs.tdengine.com/developer-guide/), which includes how an application can introduce the `taos-jdbcdriver`, as well as examples of data writing, querying, schemaless writing, parameter binding, and data subscription.
- For other reference information, see [Reference Manual](https://docs.tdengine.com/tdengine-reference/client-libraries/java/), which includes version history, data types, example programs, API descriptions, and FAQs.
- To learn about TDengine, you can visit the [official documentation](https://docs.tdengine.com).

## 3. Prerequisites
- Java 1.8 or above runtime environment and Maven 3.6 or above installed, with environment variables correctly set.
- TDengine has been deployed locally. For specific steps, please refer to [Deploy TDengine](https://docs.tdengine.com/get-started/deploy-from-package/), and taosd and taosAdapter have been started.

## 4. Build
Execute `mvn clean package` in the project directory to build the project.

## 5. Testing
### 5.1 Test Execution
Execute `mvn test` in the project directory to run the tests. The test cases will connect to the local TDengine server and taosAdapter for testing.
After running the tests, the result similar to the following will be printed eventually. If all test cases pass, both Failures and Errors will be 0.
```
[INFO] Results:
[INFO] 
[WARNING] Tests run: 2353, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 16
```

### 5.2 Test Case Addition
All tests are located in the `src/test/java/com/taosdata/jdbc` directory of the project. The directory is divided according to the functions being tested. You can add new test files or add test cases in existing test files.
The test cases use the JUnit framework. Generally, a connection is established and a database is created in the `before` method, and the database is droped and the connection is released in the `after` method.

### 5.3 Performance Testing
Performance testing is in progress.

## 6. CI/CD
- [Build Workflow](https://github.com/taosdata/taos-connector-jdbc/actions/workflows/build.yml)
- [Code Coverage](https://app.codecov.io/gh/taosdata/taos-connector-jdbc)

## 7. Submitting Issues
We welcome the submission of [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/taosdata/taos-connector-jdbc/issues/new?template=Blank+issue). When submitting, please provide the following information:

- Problem description, whether it always occurs, and it's best to include a detailed call stack.
- JDBC driver version.
- JDBC connection parameters (username and password not required).
- TDengine server version.

## 8. Submitting PRs
